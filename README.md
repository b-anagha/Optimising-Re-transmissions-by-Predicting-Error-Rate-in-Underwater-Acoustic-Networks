Underwater communication relies on specialized techniques like acoustics and optics, which are vital for applications such as marine research, military operations, and offshore industries. However, the underwater environment poses unique challenges. Acoustic signals are slower than radio waves, prone to absorption, and have limited range and data transfer rates. Factors like ocean currents and marine life introduce noise, disrupting signals and causing data corruption, reducing communication range and reliability. Signals sent by the transmitter can be misinterpreted, resulting in the loss of data packets and retransmissions. Several methods have been suggested to reduce these retransmissions, and an essential tool used by these methods to evaluate their performance is the Bit Error Rate (BER). While several methods have been developed for measuring BER, comparatively few methods have been proposed to predict BER and even fewer papers have been dedicated to studying these methods. The purpose of this paper is to review different techniques that have been proposed for evaluating, optimizing, and predicting BER in varying underwater channel conditions. Furthermore, a novel theoretical model called Predictive Underwater Retransmission Estimation (PURE) is proposed to forecast the number of retransmissions based on bit error rate (BER). This model aims to improve current methods that predict errors by evaluating the number of retransmissions.
